## Introduction

In this module we learned how to use SQL Functions to retrieve information from a database. 

For the database portion of the assignment, we 


## Explain when you would use a SQL UDF

UDF stands for 'User-Defined Function'. In addition to built-in SQL functions, users can create
their own custom functions called UDFs. There are essentially two types of UDFs: ones that return
a table of values and ones that return a single value.

There are three types of UDFs in SQL server: Scalar, 
Inline Table-Valued and Multi-Statement Table-Valued.




## Explain are the differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions

A Scalar UDF returns a single value as a result of actions performed by the function.
Scalar UDFs can accept 0 to several input parameters and will return a single value. 
A Scalar UDF returns one of the scalar data types (int, char, varchar, etc), however 
the text, ntext, image and timestamp data types are not supported.

The inline table-valued UDF returns a table variable as a result of actions completed
by the function. The inline table value function

A Multi-Statement Function also returns returns a table of data, but requires a little additional processing.
