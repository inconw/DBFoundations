## Introduction

In this module we learned how to use SQL Functions to retrieve information from a database. 
In this document we start by discussing why users make User-Defined Functions (UDFs) in SQL. Next,
we compare and contrast Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.


For the database portion of the assignment, we started by using built-functions to retrieve
specified information from our database. We also got more practice executing Views, and for 
the last portion we constructed our very own UDF.


## Explain when you would use a SQL UDF

UDF stands for 'User-Defined Function'. In addition to built-in SQL functions, users can create
their own custom functions called UDFs. There are essentially two types of UDFs: ones that return
a table of values and ones that return a single value. Among these, there are three types of UDFs 
in SQL server: Scalar, Inline Table-Valued and Multi-Statement Table-Valued.


## Explain are the differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions

A Scalar UDF returns a single value as a result of actions performed by the function.
Scalar UDFs can accept 0 to several input parameters and will return a single value. 
A Scalar UDF returns one of the scalar data types (int, char, varchar, etc), however 
the text, ntext, image and timestamp data types are not supported.

On the other hand, an inline table-valued UDF returns a table variable as a result of actions completed
by the function. A Multi-Statement Function also returns returns a table of data, but requires a little 
additional processing. 

## Conclusion
In module 07 we continued our work with SQL Views, but also moved on to include functions. We 
use built-in SQL functions to perform essential tasks (and some more complex) with the database.
Users can also customize their own functions by creating a UDF.
